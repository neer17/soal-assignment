# Learner details

## Problem Statement

Create and application where you can see the list of learners and stats of them

- Application should contain two pages

  - Learners list Page (Page 1): Diplays the list of learners
  - Learner stats page (Page 2): Displays the learner stats including profile details

> On clicking the individual learner item on Page 1 you should redirect to Page 2. You should use `react-router` to redirect from one page to another

- Page 2 should contain the following details of the learner

  - Profile details of the learner like email, phone, github, linkedin profiles etc
  - Attendance count since 3 months
  - number of commits and lines of code written since 3 months

> You can choose any graph type of your choise to display stats of learner
- Implement login authentication on frontend such that user need to login before accessing the learner's details. User can access learner's list page with/without login also. Use Redux state to manage the login state.

### Optional
- Implement Backend API and database of your choice for this application and integrate it with the frontend
- Host your application on any cloud platform like Heroku, AWS etc

#### Technologies to be used:

- **ReactJS** for creating user interfaces
- **Redux** for managing application state
- You can use any React UI library
- Creating Backend API is optional, you can use fake data to generate any data needed

### Factors you will be tested on

- Code readability & maintainability
- Functionality and/or UX
- Breakdown of problem
- Testing & Documentation
